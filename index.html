            <p>Ronald <span>Ulysses</span> "Ron" Swanson was Director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department for six years and, while believing in the elimination of government waste, always brought the department in under budget. Ron believes the government should be privatized and follow the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's family entertainment chain.
Ron ,starting from an early age, loves building things and woodwork, even winning an award for his works.
He also is shown to love unhealthy fatty high cholesterol foods like red meat and will rarely eat ethnic foods but will if it contains "meat" in its name. He despises fish and states it only should be used for sport as he considers it practically a vegetable. Ron openly despises vegetables and vegetarians/vegans alike calling plants "food that my food eats".
Ron enjoys being alone and, while he presents himself with a steely demeanor in the office, he secretly plays the saxophone as <span>Duke Silver</span>, and enjoys artichokes, plums, and intense riddles or scavenger hunts.</p>
